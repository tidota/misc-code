# C++1x/2x practice

Here, modern C++ features are practiced.

## algorithm
Practices with algorithmic features.
For more details, refer to ./algorithm/README.md

TODO: write up ./algorithm/README.md

## lambda.cpp
Defining lambda functions and calling them with different data types to see which functions are called.

## lambda2.cpp
Practicing by dealing with a lambda function as an object.

## `reference_wrapper.cpp`

TODO: reference_wrapper of unique_ptr is not a good idea. Should practice with std::ref/std::cref as the data type of these functions are reference_wrapper.

## `rvo_test.cpp`

TODO: write here

## shared.cpp

TODO: write here

## tuple.cpp

TODO: write here

## unique.cpp
